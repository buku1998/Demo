bangalore_home_prices_final.ipynb is the main python file which contains the python code for house price prediction based on area and location. We have used grid search CV to find out which model tuned with which hyperparameter gives the best result. 

Bengaluru_House_Data.csv is the dataset used in this project. This dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com, the link to the dataset is also given in the python code.

bhp.csv is the modified dataset which has been cleaned and is fit for use in the code.

bangalore_home_prices_model.pickle is generated so that a web page can be built in the future.

columns.json contains all the column headers which I feel is also important for web page generation.

To execute the code open the bangalore_home_prices_final.ipynb, modify the file paths in different parts of the code and execute.
